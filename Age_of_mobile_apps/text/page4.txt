Mobile apps, as opposed to browser apps, are developed specifically and exclusively for use in mobile devices.
Native Apps
A native application (native app) is an application program that has been developed for use on a particular platform or device, e.g., iOS (Apple’s mobile operating system), and Android (Google’s mobile operating system).
Hybrid Apps
