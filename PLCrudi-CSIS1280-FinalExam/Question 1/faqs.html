		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>In this section we will be answering a few questions that arise when one is talking about mobile/web applications. The main questions are as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>What types of apps exist?</li>
			<li>How much does development cost?</li>
			<li>How does one make money with different apps?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Through answering these questions and the by product, we will be able to thoroughly understand the implications of mobile apps and also add concrete information to the TCEI model in the following section.</p>
		<h2>What kind of apps are there?</h2>
		<dl><strong>Native App</strong>
			<dd>Native apps are programs that actually live on the device (in this case a mobile phone) and are accessed through downloading and installing the app via an application store. They are designed specifically for one platform(usually known for either Android or IPhone’s) and can make use of all the device features such as the GPS, camera, list on contacts(for example to sync contacts with their prospective profiles like on the Facebook application). Another feature that differentiates native apps from the other kinds is the ability to work offline and use the notification system of the device itself.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<dl><strong>Web App</strong>
			<dd>A web app is not a native app but in quite some cases they look and operate the same as native apps. In actuality, they are websites, which users would have access to by navigating a URL to site and have to option to download and bookmark them on their home screen or designated page. By running as a normal website on a mobile device through a browser, usually they are supported by software such as JavaScript or HTML5 in order to operate on the mobile device. The resemblance to a native app is quite large, which is a reason why they could be confused with one another but this type of app has its constraints. Constraints such as, not being able to use the mobile device’s own notification system, leaving the app running in the background possibility, the need to be connected to internet therefore not being able to work offline etc.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
		<strong>Hybrid app</strong>
			<dd>This app is exactly what the name implies; it is a hybrid, therefore a combination of both the web mobile application and the native application. Just like a native app, it can be accessed through a download from the app store and use various device features but also relies on the HTML being rendered in a browser. Companies mostly build such aps as an extension for an existing web page and thus position their company on multiple fronts(on the app store and web page) while getting a bang for their buck by not having to spend as much money on the investment as to a native application.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<h2>How much does it cost to development an App?</h2>
		<p>Building a native app would be the most costly approach because one would have to build an entirely new app that is centrally focused on operating on one platform, therefore being more intricate, while creating a web app would be the less costly approach since it is less difficult because this would require skills that rely on the experience with the web. Also creating a web app or hybrid app can be done by simply using other platforms such as Aperry.io or Mobile roadie, which can be highly beneficial for non-experienced people while being affordable. These programs can accessed for a 180 dollars a month (Appery.io in this example) with a step by step and drag and drop approach for an easier function, while being accessible to anyone who wants to make a mobile app.</p>
		<p>Regardless, using HTML5 to create a web or hybrid app is still difficult for a beginner therefore using one of these plans could be beneficial for a non-expert. Therefore, a native app would require expertise from professional or advanced app developers to create an entirely new app while web apps and hybrid apps use the best of both worlds while being on a budget.</p>
		<h2>How can you generate revenue through mobile apps?</h2>
		<p>There are a number of ways to earn money with mobile applications through applying one of the following pricing and revenue models.</p>
		<ol class="roman">
			<li>
			<strong> Freemium</strong>
			<p>In this model, an app would be offered to user free of charge but with limited features and at a later date the users can download the extra features through in- app purchasing. This model is the most popular revenue generating model and removes the initial buy price and lets the user see the worth of the app and decide to make a purchase for all the features.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>Single time paid apps</strong>
			<p>Users pay only once to download the app and all additional updates and features are expected to be free. This would mean that the app should be attractive enough for users to pay for a download with giving them a taste of the app with a sample.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>Multi-payment apps with added paid features.</strong>
			<p>This strategy is a combination of the previous two, which is paying for the initial download but also paying for extra features once downloaded. This strategy is tricky because one could argue that consumers would not pay easily for a limited feature and then again pay for extra features but this all depends on the demand of the product and whether it fulfills the need of the user to even want to provide further purchasing habits.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>Free apps with advertising.</strong>
			<p>This last model is quite simple, users can download the app for free but the app will display certain advertisements therefore the success of this approach would rely on heavy traffic( a high number of users) in order to increase the pay-per-click ratio for it to be profitable.</p></li>
