			<div class="area numbers">Adorer of numbers: I think that would be the expression that can describe me as a professional. I have the ability to easily learn. When I started working it was for the government of my country, Brazil, in order to get a government position you have to pass some knowledge tests, and I am proud to say that I was successful in several stages, thus building a legacy in the department where I worked. To get a position above which I held, I had to graduate. I reconciled my need with my passion.</div>

			<div class="area college">I chose the Math course to be my major degree, therefore it was watching an IBM lecture that I discovered the area of Data Analysis. I became so interested in the subject that I decided to start a postgraduate course in another country, Canada, where I would have the opportunity to learn this new profession in one of the best Colleges. As I have no experience in the area, I am aware that I will need to obtain some certificates and undertake an internship to be a competent Data Analyst. I started the Google Data Analysis course and later I will take the IBM Data Science course, in addition to trying to absorb all the knowledge I am acquiring at the College.</div>
